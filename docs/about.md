## About

`kickoff` is a Command-Line tool, which can be used to easily create boilerplate code for new projects and other things based on archetypes stored in GitHub repos.

You can do the following things with `kickoff`:

1. Install kickoff in global mode.
2. Create the repository on github for the project template, including mustache templates.
3. Place the `.kickoff.yml` file,
   to define the questionnaire for collecting parameter values for template files.

In order to learn more about how to install and use the tool, read the [Get Started](getStarted.html) page, then continue with reading the [documentation](documentation.html).
